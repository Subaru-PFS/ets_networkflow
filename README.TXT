tar -zxf gurobi7.0.2_linux64.tar.gz
gedit $HOME/.bashrc

input the following at the end of the file:

 export GUROBI_HOME="/FULL/PATH/gurobi702/linux64"
 export PATH="${PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/bin"
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/lib"
 export GRB_LICENSE_FILE="$HOME/gurobi.lic"


Notice the /FULL/PATH part. This is where you downloaded the package, but it has to be the full path there. You can use $HOME to reference your home folder. For instance, your Desktop is in $HOME/Desktop. My packages folder is $HOME/packages. Also notice the GRB_LICENSE_FILE variable. If you intend to put your license somewhere else, youâ€™ll need to change that part.

After that is done you need to either (a) close and reopen the terminal or (b) input source $HOME/.bashrc.
